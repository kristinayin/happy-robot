calculator stuff

Hey guys! This is a repository featuring selected calculator programs that I have created. The intent is for others to be able to use these progams for school, life, etc. Please feel free to use them, but I trust that I will be credited (with a link to my account) if needed.

Enjoy, Kristina

NOTE: I have a TI-84 CE.
